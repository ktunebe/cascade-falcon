# note-taking-app

## Description

This is a project for UW Bootcamp in which we were asked to create a note-taking app. Using Node.js and Express.js, a server is created which will take API requests to get, post and delete notes to. These notes are then stored and can be accessed or deleted later. The app is deployed live using Render.

## Installation

No installation needed.

## Usage

The user will input a title and body for each note they would like to create, and on submission a unique ID is given to each note. The notes are then stored and can be viewed individually by clicking on them. Notes can be deleted by clicking on the trash can next to the note.
